*Thanks for giving us the oportunity to present our work and what we do here in EGGS Design, is a pleasure, although Nerve-wreking, to introduce ourselves to the city of Trondheim with this presentation, thank you.

*Mari and I started our coaching businesses about 6 years ago out of our common fascination for the human mind, personal development and the psychedelic renaissance movements; Yes we are married and we could have made only one company, but we are both too stubborn üòù*
*We created two approaches of "coaching"; You wil meet her a bit later when she tells you a bit more of what she does, which happens to be much more interesting than what I do*üò£... [^3]

*I would like to state the importance of self-work with a little epiphany I had, that ultimatey lead to start Mindwork/s, it came when I was thinking about the future*

When it comes to thinking about the future, there seems to be 2 main proyections, Utopian and Dystopian, and I imagine that we all agree on wanting to live Here (Utopia) more than there (Dystopian), (even though the dystopian might make for a much better movie üòÖ)

What would you like to call home? This one right? (engage by making them vote) So what is the fundamental difference? Wealth? yes but there is a good deal of peace, and united harmonious work, some sort of collective agreement on design even, and after all, what does fundamentally supports the wealth difference?

Would be fairly easy to assume that the main difference between both scenarios are its technological advancements, but that is only a piece of the puzzle, how that technology and wealth came to appear?
Well another way to see this is that both are after all a places where people inhabits, so this is a comparison.


Here we have a home from catalog and the house of a hoarder, and from this point of view seems easier to realize that the fundamental difference, [^7] is the mental health and wellbeing of those who live in that envioronment.

So where are the most organized people? the ones that know how to deal with their economy and their relationships and time? Where are the most cooperative? Exactly, the way we relate to ourselves and one another, the way we cooperate, the energy we bring, and the meaning that we carry with us are the pillars of the future we strive for.
Every time I help a client see a self sabotaging mechanism, or build the courage to to stand for himself or present his idea to an investor, there is another grain of sand in the balance towards the future we all want.

In order to design our minds so that we become the kind of person from the future we want, we need to know how do we fundamentally work.[^9] So today I will share with you a model that wil show fundamental mechanics of the mind, and along the way we will talk about things we can do to shape it and de-bug it.

The levels are[^10] the **The core**, which is the body, the **Subconscious**, which is the emotional mind, then we have the **Conscious** mind, or the intellect and lastly, **Supra-conscious**, which is all about meaning, purpose, connectedness, lastly we have the "outside" world, our work, the news, our friends and family. Your conscious experience is the product all this layers functioning together. 

Imagine this as if every layer would affect the shape of layer above it, [^11] all of them are interconnected and contribute to the final "shape", and this shape is [^12] how we manifest in the world, world which in turn, affects us back. 


So as you can imagine by now, any weakspot or problem will too affect all other layers, and it will affect its final shape. And if you cannot roll, you get this feeling of being stuck in life or worse. It does not matter how smart you are if you have a cronic pain that makes you unable to think.
This means that "**Everything Matters and is connected to everything else**" that is why Mari and I work wholisticaly or have a Systems thinking approach if you like that word best.

Now, the point is not to become a perfect "sphere", nobody is nor should be, the point is to be able to "roll your true own way through life"
lets break this model down so we know how all our levels work and affect eachother:

So now [^13] is when I will get some enemies so I'll keep this short. *"Everything you experience, the way you think, the mood you have, the energy at your disposal, your focus and concentration, Everything! is in one way or another, intimately connected and colored by the state of your body"*, so much so, that I would say this is the first and foremost place to check and ask ourselves wether everything is in order and smooth.

.[^14] What are arguably the 3 main pillars of health? Sleep, Food, and everyones favourite, Exercise. We are made of the food we eat litterally, are your hands made of good things or are you mostly "rearanged pizza"? Sleeps is important, that's how we consolidate learning, and go through emotional resolution processes very similar to therapy, and sleep is the only time our neurons have to dispose of the waste accumulated throughout the day, and what to say about exercise? Putting all your body in the movement that was designed through evolution to do is what regulates your drive, vitality, mental energy, and almost every neurotransmitor you need to don't feel lique a potato". 


And Right here in the start I see a caveat over and over, lets say you start feeling more and more grumpy and angry, instead of resorting to google "5 timps to anger management" I would actually start by this 3 questions:
[^15]
- **Am I sleeping what I think I could?** 
- **Am I eating as healthy as secretly think I should?
- **Am I honestly exercising and using my body enough?**
So answer these questions, and If you consider that there is some work to do here, begin researching some information about what you can do and get bussy, youll will feel better. There is a list of links of high cuality resources in the handout you can check.

Great! let's walk a step up in the model and talk about the unconscious or Emotional mind!

I like to think about emotions like [^17] **the fundamental source of action**. Emotions are the solution that evolution came up with to the question **"what should I do right now?**" and survival is the first, second and third priority. ing 
The things that are familiar to you make you feel safe so you will gravitate towards them, the unfamiliar ones will trigger discomfort and fear to one or another degree and you'll feel repelled about them. Following our emotions to the T will perfectly achieve its main goal, Survival. They tell us when to run, and towards what and also make us stop, and escape, but is much more complex than that, they make us protect, and hug eachother, they make us eat and rest, work hard and party in other words, they move us because that is what they are for. 


One thing to know about emotions is that emotional processing goes first, and then goes your conscious awareness and intellect which feedbacks to the emotional center. that is because if something requires you to run or to fight ASAP you dont have time to contemplate the moment and all your body needs to act as quicly as possible, so, that's why trying to dialog with someone who is infuriated has never worked on the hystory of mankind, and is very reccomended to take a break relax and get a hold of yourself, before trying to resolve a discussion that is getting heated.


Now! Let's make a thought experiment. Try by all means to be scared right now, close your eyes if you need to and bring up the emotion of "Fear" at will, yes, make yourself feel scared for a moment, good. allright openning the eyes now, you are safe üòÑ, 
Who managed to feel a bit of afraid? Let's put attention to what we did  in the privacy of you our mind, my guess is that you did not just become affraid in a single step, but you used one or another technique. 

Like you imagined something, or recalled a memory, which you played in your head and then somehow your physiology reacted to that "internal movie" with "Fear"? What can we learn from this? first, we react emotionally to our internal thought and mental pictures without exception. If you allways resort to the worst case scenarios, a part of you will act as if its happening right now so you wont let yourself take a break or make a joke because the internal world you live in that is not an option. 

Now, some of you might have used a diffferent technique, like breathing and acting as if you where affraid until the emotion appears and that is quite smart because it leads us to one common myth about emotions.

Usually, when we think of emotions, we think of this but the truth is that they are more like this
**emotions are not just mental processes, they are full body reactions** that colours our behaviour, our thinking, and our decision making. And this is important because we have learned to repress the ones we dont like. The problem of this is that even if you pretend to not be angry, your body is fired up by the anger and you need an equal force to suppress it, when that happens constantly, you are litterally chocking your body and therefore "seemingly unrelated" problems like back and neck pains, headache, lack of energy and the like will appear, that's why is said that ***"The emotion that is not heard nor expressed, it will manifest through the body with sickness"***

Next myth I need to takle is the **good vs bad** emotions. Wether we like them or not, there are No Bad Emotions, they have all a very important role to play in our survival, and they have arised through evolution for a good reason. Even if sometimes they stay in the way of our goals, they are always the whole point. They are the drivers of our actions and what keeps not only us,  but the whole animal kingdom alive. 

Another big mistake we make, the one I cal "**I am not emotional"** is funny because ussually that is said with a good deal of pride. Most of the time emotions are subtle, Plus they are part of the unconscious so we are not aware of them by design, so we tend to notice them when we witness outbursts of them, someone cries, or gets angry or cannot stop laughting. The truth is that right now you are feeling a subtle emotion, I just hope is not boredom. Becoming aware of subtler and subtler emotions is a skill that you can hone in, and you want to do that because if you are oblivious to your emotions and how they color your thinking and your reactions, they will allways run you. 

That's why Jung said "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."


##### Why to work on our emotions

So then what do we do with them? We cannot be runned by them, we would become irrational, erratic and would be chaos right? Well, yes and no. 
We cannot be Slaves or puppets of our emotions, that's true, but they will allways, allways run the show... The good news is that you can choose which ones do.


In the worksheet you have an exercise called **Emotional baseline**. 
First there is a collumn to be filled with the emotions that you feel the most often, the emotions that "are running your life". Those are the emotions that you are have the greatest skill to run, so you will have a natural tendency to **fall back to your baseline**. 
The second column, are the ones you would like to "run your show" Like, in your wildest dreams, without intellectualizing much, would you like to feel powerful? would you like to feel what? You, energized, at peace, engaged, happy, proud, good, list them up and we will call that your future emotional baseline. Good, now what do we do? 

As the thought experiment demonstrated, we can willfully play pictures in your head that our body will react to and a also we know that our emotions are sensations in the body and we have conscious controll of the body as well. These are our bridges to emotional mastery. 

Good way to do this is to take 10 minutes to visualize or better yet, write, about things that would make you feel that way, the same as you thought of spiders in the thought experiment, make yourself actually feel something from the second list, swim in a pool of money, imagine that you kill a dragon it does not matter, use your creative imagination!


Another way is to engage the body in movements related with those emotions, like breath powerfully to feel energized or deeply for calmness. You can walk the way you would walk if you felt a great selfsteem, or smile as if you just won the lottery.

Do this several times at day, for several months, you will get better and better at running those emotions and they will begin "running your show".


Now we are comming to the level of intellectuality, this is all about thinking effectively, strategically and mindfully. Most of the Self-help industry is focused here already but there are some things to touch on.


Firstly, there is nothing most fundamental than this: Failing = Learning. 
Repeat with me, Failing = Learning, once more, Failing = Learning. Good, we need to change our internal dictionary, Failiure is the only means to improve anything at all. This is how nature brought us into existence, Evolution works by failure. 
Produce a solution, test it to failure, improve it and discard what fails, reiterate. 
Likewhise, test the service or product in it's envioronment, check what goes wrong and improve it, discard what is not needed, reiterate. 
The problem is that many times we are attached to our creations in the wrong way and dont want to change them.


Never get attached to the form, but its essence. 
Imagine you come up with an idea to solve a problem, let's say "A machine that cleans dishes". You make this machine, and you get horrible feedback, is too big and complicated!. Now, the physical machine is "the form", if you are attached to it, all the feedback will hurt you, because it seems that "your idea is not good enough". This can lead to self savotage like perfectionism and procastination, any means to delay future pain.
Now, what is the essence? yes, "Cleaning dishes". that's what to attach yourself to. Every negative feedback automatically becomes new information to create a new form like, it must clean dishes, be small, simple to use, well, let's try this!

 
Now, our conscious mind is what we use to navigate the complexity of modern times and we must take choices in the daily basis. The total sum of all those choice outcomes has created the live you have right now.
So I will give you the strongest framework to get a clear thinking about moving fordward I know of, I use this with my clients all the time and now is gonna be yours for the cheap price of not falling asleep during the next 5 minutes.üòÇ
![[6 Coaching Questions Sigil.png\|6 Coaching Questions Sigil.png]]
I present you, the pathfinding questions, that sigil will help you remember them. 
##### One: What is the situation?
braindump everything in mind about your current situation, in general terms, let it out.
##### Two: Where are you at now?
Be utterly honest, clear and precise about where you are at.Admit whatever must be admited, admit what you dont know, what you are affraid, you can burn the paper later on.
##### 3:What is the Ideal scenario?"
Be concrete and specific, what do you see hear and feel when that is a reality? or how will you know that you got there?
##### 4: Why dont you have it right now? 
And NEVER blame anything beyond your power, if your mind tricks you into blaming someone else or thge weather, then work yourself back into a place of empowerment, lack of resources?=why dont you have them? cold outside= why does that stops you? this way you will take ownership.
##### 5: What can you do? 
Now is when we get into creative mode, and brainstorm ideas, no matter how out of the box, weird crazy or unlikely, but all are actions that you could actually perform.
##### 6: What will you do? 
At least one of the previous answers will scream your attention, so here is where you make a commitment bound by space and time on a given set of actions, now there is one rule about choosing what you commit to, it must be "the greatest smallest step that you know you cannot fail at doing", must be the greatest because you want to strech yourself, but smallest because you want to be 100% sure you can, and will perform it.
Become good at answering these questions often even daily and you will get wherever you want in life


I must tank my mentor Robert Ellis, founder of Futurosity for teaching me this, they are simple, but this is what fortune500 coaching looks like. You cannot answer these 6 questions and not knowing exactly what to do, and wether you succeed or ...learn something new, you will be in a new place, so ask the questions again.


To finish on the Conscious level of the model, Mari will talk about the world of Graphology and handwritting annalisis, yeah, I told you that was cooler than what I do üòÖ 
(12 minutes)

"So now we are with what I call supra conscious, that is our spirituality or our meaning... hmm... I thing that to touch this I will tell you about a true story. 

I want you to think about a kid that  was born in a fairly poor family, and his whole childhood was a misture of screams, tears, humiliations, an abusive household envioroment, now the point is that this kid, he really thought that santaclaus was real and only him would read his letter, and year by year, every year, regardless of what he was going through daily, he would go and write something such as "Dear santa, I don't want anything for me, you can bring me absolutely nothing, but please, please, help those kids from africa so they have something to eat instead." and so it came another dissapointing christams in which santa ignored him and gave him some toys, every year untill he grow old enough to understand why that happened.

I tell this because, I might be wrong, but I believe that kid was not alone secretly whishing such thing, as a matter of fact, I am sure that most of us, at some point really whished to end world hunger, deforestation, war, polution, animal cruelty, media manipulation, somethign "huge" although very very simple. give a plate of food to every living being t or, dont pull the trigger, is quite simple.. but with this I mean that beneath all our differences, and particularities, and egoic games we have learned to play to survive, there is a common sincere and gutural wish to make the world a better fucking place, now, if you manage to unearth that moment in which you thought about this, before you had to bury it and let it go to fit in and told yourself that you where being naive, and you take that moment, that whish and you hone on it and protect it and stand by it And you p ut your mind an spirit to EXPLAIN TO YOURSELF how the very thing that you are doing right now, and the goals that you are porsuing right now plays a very important, crucial role in the common global wish that unite us... that's when you will become... unstopable. 

Thank you
