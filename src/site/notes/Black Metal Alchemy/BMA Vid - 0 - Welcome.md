## Video Guide

[nature shot with voice over]
*"In a land of  slaves, walking free is an act of rebellion"*
- lack of self trust-awareness-acceptance
- going in circles searching for answers that nobody has
- tired of never being quite enough
[fade in into shot of me getting ready with voice over]
- what am I doing wrong? Am I broken?
- do this, do that, remember to X, stop to Y...
- what about the addictions, anxiety, depressions?
- How do I re-ignite the fire within?
[Talking to the camera]
- Presenting that the problem is not the viewer
	- so, you think that the problem here is X?
- the problem is the social domestication imposed on you since before you could talk
- the educational system indoctrination process on obedience, acceptance and performance you where put through
- the constant emotional manipulation you suffer from marketing
- The lies you have been told for profit or other purpose
- What about the constant brainwashing from the big institutions of your country?
- the lack of connection between people in modern days? 
- for not mentioning the verbal, emotional and physical abuse you have might have been put through on top of that, worse even if that was from parents or caretakers. 
[Closer up]
The point is not about dwelling in victimhood, [Closest] I want you to think clearly.
You recall the day in school in which the teacher asked your opinion about the curriculum, assignments or school processes?
No? The one in which you where toght on how to calm your mind and body to deal with external pressure? did you had the assignments tailored on what you liked or where curious about? how to find your own way and processes? how to reason critically and make sense of the world around you?
Honestly, give or take you where on your own to learn about the crucial aspects of life, if lucky you figured out, if not, you still have questions. And of top of that, you where forcefed with tons content that you never used in your adult life.
you where tought to be ashamed of not knowing, fearful of failure and terrified of not fitting in.
you where tought to accept what is, behave as accepted, don't question authority.
in other words.
you have been relentlessly tought to be what others want you to be, while never showing you how to think by yourself, be, yourself.
And the problems becomes invisible when everyone else has gone through the same lobotomy process.
self help says that your present life is the convictions of all choices you have taken. I say that this is bullshit, You might have never taken a genuine choice in your fucking life.
I say that you have all the right to rebell against this, in mind, body and spirit.
And here is how you can make your first act of revellion: you need to put this 2 together by your own, in one hand you have whatever inner struggles you have, in the other all the lessons you got so far. problem being, "I don't know what to do in life" where you told?" impulse control? what can you ask from someone with this framework? figure out this connections.


[Change of scene, perhaps out?]
also, you are not excempt from this, no mater how intelligent or baddass you are, much less how successful you believe to be, after all, you surely bought into a toxic definition of success that was given to you.
taking all this into consideration, I think that is a miracle that you are even alive.
From this prespective, on things, most of the useless guilt trip should be dealt with, three is no rule in the universe that says that yuo must do nothing,  become nothing, or change anything within you, and with the cards you where dealt with you most likely could not have ended in a much better place than te one you are now. but ... there is a catch...
is still your problem.
So how do you breack free from the heard, recconnect accept and become what you where meant to naturally become, and create a life you cannot even dream of?
Let me introduce you to     Modern Alchemy

[animation begins]
Alchemy was, in a sense, the art of Trans mutate or transforming, with the goal of trans-mutating something mundane as lead, into something extremely precious such as gold.

In truth, you have been doing the same, you have been transforming yourself, with learning for example, with the goal of transmutation of something mundane, in this case your life, into something extremely precious, such a reality in which you can be yourself without being judged, broke, prescription drugged and fucking miserable.
Modern alchemy works from the conviction that you have all you need, the tools, resources and capavilities to achieve whatever you set yourself to achieve, you are not broken, damaged, not enough, too old, young, etc.. 

Also, Any mental issue, taken that is not caused by brain injury or malformation, tends to be either a perfectly correct adaptation to an environment (a violent childhood for example) that no longer exists (you are an adult now), which creates dissonance between you and your present situation; or you happen to have born with a mental structure that is best suited for another type of environment (another type of job, country or lifestyle) and the dissonance between you and your environment makes you conclude that you, happen to be the problem, which is just, wrong.

life is a gradual transformation and throughout that journey, you need only one thing. Guidance and support, but not as in, "Just follow me" that would make you dependent and a sheep. you need guidance to teach you how to find your way around your world, so you become the autonomous being you where design by evolution to be.

All serious spiritual paths, from millennia, specially the left-hand path ones have  in common that the "transformation" itself is not so much about "learning" something new, but from unlearning what we have indoctrinated since childhood, all the social rules, and drama, hierarchies, beliefs and concepts, fears, you name it, forget all the crap that we got and that made us belief that we had to change ourselves in order to be accepted, loved and fulfilled.

This so called "transformation" is nothing else than de-transformation, or better said, purification into whatever you where simply meant to be come, if you weren't been forced fed to eat oceans of human bullshit to survive.

Modern Alchemy has:
1 goal, your Magnum Opus
2 step process, "Solve et Coagula" Dissolve and coagulate or solidify.
3 Principles.
	The all is one
	Know thyself
	Do what you wilt
The magnum opus:
You are it
Solve et coagula:
The purification process
Dissolving is any process in which you look inwards and study what you see, by doing that you dissect the pieces of your psychology and personality. Journaling for example falls in this category. 
Solidifying process is when you took out the garbage you found away and put the cleaner pieces together. Creating a habit would be a solidifying process.
Now is the time to mention psychedelics.
Psychedelics happen to work this precise way with your ego. When you take it, your sense of self weakens, to the point that it can dispensary; this is what is commonly refereed as ego death, or ego dissolution.  
Once you come back from the trip, WHICH YOU ALWAYS, INEQUIVOCALY, WITHOUT ANY SINGLE ROOM TO QUESTION OR DOUBT ALWAYS DO!! And you begin the integration process, that is the solidifying process.
The way this happens in the brain is actually awesome but we will talk about it in another video, so stay tuned. And thanks for not forgetting AT ALL to like and share this video.
This is why at some point I will talk about using them as a tool.
So, what's the goal?

![Pasted image 20230406173439.png](/img/user/All%20Media/Pasted%20image%2020230406173439.png)
"The all is One", this is a nondual pointer, or a principle of, more on what that means in another video, but for now think of it as strength comes from unity and growth, not by separating and dividing. If you want to put an idea into the world, instead of becoming neurotic about it, share it, make people involved, the more the idea grows, the stronger it becomes. Solve the problems between you and your friends instead of criticizing and making the gap bigger. The opposite works as well, "Divide and conquer". 

"Know thyself" we have distort ourselves so much throughout our lives that we have no idea what or who we are, what we want or would thrive doing are considered mysteries on the western world by most. since the moment you where told not to do/say/touch something as a quid with a thread or emotional punishment, instead of an explanation, you had to fight against yourself thereafter, dissociating and creating a virtual, perfect, ideal and completely absurdly unattainable version of yourself that you strive to become at the price of anxiety and endless self doubt for not achieving it. This happens to almost if not absolutely everyone, and I want you to rebel against this Toxic way being. Your magnum opus, philosopher stone, that is , what you will work towards for the rest of your life will be absolute self-acceptance. bad self stem will be something absurd to consider.

"Do what you wilt"
Once you get more and more in touch with what, who and how you are, the closer and closer you will be from being able to create and manifest your will, your personal artform, do what you are meant to do naturally, that creates value to the world, without you having to push, force, or go through what goes against your nature. 

To wrap up, I believe you have all that is needed, to become, not what others tell you to want to become, but to become what you where meant to be, assertive, tough, independent, free, warm and vulnerable wen need it, but absolutely Lethal wen required.

So keep posted for the next episode, support this vision with the links in the description, and most important of all, keep strong, in your quest for ultimate awesome.


## Intro
My name is Carlos Miquel Koivula, I've always been interested about psychology, philosophy, science and spirituality, the list does not end there by any means as I also have a nerd side, yet my passions are Black Metal, in 2011 I moved to Norway with the dream of becoming a black metal vocalist in the Norwegian black metal scene, which led to becoming Ødemark in the band The 3rd Attempt. 
I am also passionate about, why not say it straight, drugs, at least some of them, most of them perhaps, specially psychedelics.
But if I have to spot my most fundamental obsession, what has fueled me over the years has to be the concepts of rebellion and freedom, but not political only, I talk in an existential, almost spiritual domain. I mean freedom of mind of thinking for oneself, rebellion towards the preset destiny that the starting conditions of your life seems to impose. 
I love helping people to think, to discover their innate strengths and do what they believe to be impossible, against all odds. That is my act of rebellion, and why I have become a coach... of sorts.
last decade I became interested in self actualization, and when I discovered psychedelics and experienced the profound benefit they made in psyche, I became interested on the concept of therapy, I learned hypnotherapy along the way, but the truth, to me, no therapy can compare to the lasting effects that a good mushroom, acid or MDMA trip, taken that they are used with the right intentions, setting, guidance, and integration. 
I know the struggles of being an empath, neurodivergence, bipolar disorder, depression, self harm, complex PTSD and addiction first hand, and on my search for improving my own life I discovered that most, not all, but most of psychologists, coaches, therapists, personal development,  and spiritual and thought leaders , are well, full of shit, not willingly though, I don't want to demonize or generalize too much, but the biases in this industries is simply unacceptable to me. 

So that is why I am putting together the new concept of 
## Modern Alchemy
Reality is only one, there is only one truth, so when you find people disagreeing and contradicting each-other about a given subject, you know there is something going on there, there is another paradigm, another way to see things, that needs to emerge. And since I am sick and tired of waiting for people to admit their shit and begin collaborating instead of competing to who has the biggest intellectual dick, I am gonna put it together and will share it with you here.
My times with the occult are long gone, so I will keep the woo woo to a minimum, you need a clear mind, no another system of obfuscated, subjective, and distracting knowledge. Also, I still love real science, so I cannot deal with contradictions between empirical evidence and metaphysics, in other words, Modern Alchemy will be a path that merges science and research, with spirituality, metaphysics and mysticism, in order to explain the human condition we are all slaves to.
There is another edge that pushes me to do this, and that is that there is an army worth of perfectly functional, intelligent, capable, well intended people paralysed by anxiety and drowning in self doubt and depression, even about to kill themselves, while at the same time the world is full of psychopathic, narcissistic assholes feeling way too well about their fucking obnoxious selves and are about to do something you would regard as absolutely horrifying. All this is fueled by a bunch of well intended people that can help, protecting their ideas with branding and copyrights and pricing their help to survive and try to escape the rat race. To me, all this must be open source, do with it what you will, that shall be the whole of the law.
Why "Black Metal alchemist", instead of "Modern alchemist"? Well, the philosophy and concept of BM has helped me survive as myself, it was a very deep and serious way of life, and one of the things I loved from it is that began with an active rebellious act, against the manipulative institution of religion, and they where god damn serious. Now it seems that all that remains is a music style, parody videos, and a bunch of misunderstood artists trying to channel their hatred and inner voids through their music. 

I say that is time to get active again, just instead of the mindless burning and the bloodshed, inspired by Satan, with the knowledge and illumination inspired by Lucifer. And instead of trying to destroy religion and the like, we will make it obsolete and let them wither by liberating minds. 
Well, it makes sense to me.
Of course you don't have to like black metal or know anything about it to get something out of this, you are subject to the same manipulations, traumas, and problems that the human condition carries with it, so if you are not into it, just ignore the "Theme" and apply the knowledge shared.

So, Modern alchemy, what is it? 
Alchemy was, in a sense, the art of Trans mutate or transforming, with the goal of trans-mutating something mundane as lead, into something extremely precious such as gold.

In truth, you have been doing the same, you have been transforming yourself, with learning for example, with the goal of transmutation of something mundane, in this case your life, into something extremely precious, such a reality in which you can be yourself without being judged, broke, prescription drugged and fucking miserable.

The modern approach is to put everything in conceptual boxes, you need a therapist if the problem is due to trauma, and a coach if the problem comes from time management, or a guru if your problem is existential. Well, after working in the 3 fields, I concluded that those boxes are making everything worse than already is, resulting on unnecessary pain and even deaths.
I see it as a spectrum. In one end, you where born, the other, you die. Most traumatic experiences are the result of experiences in childhood, and the repercussions of them over time, but there is also the indoctrination and pressures of a dysfunctional education system, in youth, and your experiences at work or university and so on. at some point of maturity will start questioning things about your existence. Everything is gradual transformation and throughout that journey, you need only one thing. Guidance and support. 
You need someone or something that can guide you through resolving childhood trauma, but also planning a career change, and reconnecting you with your existential essence, there is no difference, all are questions about the human experience. 
No fear and shame from "needing therapy", no guilt tripping from "not being hard working enough" , no nonsense. by the way, you want to know what the real Matrix is? The matrix is the simulation that we create using this conceptual boxes, they are in fact the "pixels" so to say, of the simulation, and we believe on those concepts so much, that we mistake them with reality itself, that's what "the map vs the territory" means in the book simulacra and simulation, the book the matrix was inspired and based on, but I am going astray now. 

Any mental issue, taken that is not caused by brain injury or malformation, tends to be either a perfectly correct adaptation to an environment (a violent childhood for example) that no longer exists (you are an adult now), which creates dissonance between you and your present situation; or you happen to have born with a mental structure that is best suited for another type of environment (another type of job, country or lifestyle) and the dissonance between you and your environment makes you conclude that you, happen to be the problem. I reject this idea.

All you need is the guidance to navigate your world, but not as in, "Just follow me" that would make you dependent and a sheep. you need guidance to teach you how to find your way around your world, so you become the autonomous being you where design by evolution to be, I see this as your inherent birth right, you did not choose to be a human, and be subject to all this crap, so at least you deserve the guidance to navigate it, do with it what you will, that shall be the whole of the law.

To even consider stepping out of most socially accepted frameworks takes courage, the good part is that that courage resides within you.

There is a particular thought that made me realize that Nature is infinite orders of magnitude wiser than our intellect can grasp, and that is when I began realizing that through millennia, spiritual paths of all sorts, cultures and ages has one thing in common. 
All serious spiritual seeking from Buddhists, Indus, pagan, mystical traditions, the occult, enlightenment work... they all have  in common that the "transformation" itself is not so much about "learning" something new, but from unlearning what we have indoctrinated since childhood, all the social rules, and drama, hierarchies, beliefs and concepts, fears, you name it, forget all the crap that we got and that made us belief that we had to change ourselves in order to be accepted, loved and fulfilled. in other words, if we would just let ourselves grow as we let plants do, so they express their naturally occurring shapes, none of this would happen.

This so called "transformation" is nothing else than de-transformation, or better said, purification into whatever you where simply meant to be come, if you weren't been forced fed to eat oceans of human bullshit to survive.
How does Alchemy approaches the process of purification? "Solve et Coagula" Dissolve and coagulate or solidify.
Dissolving is any process in which you look inwards and study what you see, by doing that you dissect the pieces of your psychology and personality. Journaling for example falls in this category. 
Solidifying process is when you took out the garbage you found away and put the cleaner pieces together. Creating a habit would be a solidifying process.

And since its me the one speaking, I'll be sure that we have a blast, and we raise parties of apocalyptic proportions, and explore the world, destroy our stupid limits and sodomize our "inner demons" on the way.
