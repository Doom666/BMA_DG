Modern alchemy is the framework I will use on my youtube channel and podcasts. [[Mindwork-s\|Mindwork-s]] will be a Coaching and education plattform in which little by little we will standarize the self help industry.


# Modern Alchemy
“Therapy, Coaching, and Spirituality meets the left-hand path for the modern human”

One goal, 2 processes, 3 principles:

The Goal is called “Magnum Opus”, a life in which you manifest in your one true form through your *Artform*, the creative expression of your essence's will, that will generate value in the world without any effort or strain from your part. The magnum opus is a gradual achievement that is directly related to the purity of your Self from the pollution of society, we call this your Self-purity.
In the early stages, your MO will grant the freedom from *hell*, which refers to states of mind such as suicidal tendencies, self-harm, depression, self-hatred, toxic relationships, homelessness, addictions, meaninglessness, strong personality dysfunctions and the like.
The next stages of your MO will manifest as complete freedom from self-doubt, insecurities, undesired addictions, self sabotage, people-pleasing pressures, and poverty.
The advanced stages will grant revelations, higher purpose, world-scale impact, self-mastery, effortless influence and value creation, flow state awareness.
Beyond that, the mystical stages of MO will grant complete freedom from the Ego, Non-dual state of awareness, illumination, liberation and mystical experiences such as omniscience, immortality, and god-realization.
There are no rules on what stages to achieve, everyone is free from staying in a stage and call it life, any stages are as valuable, and There is one stage that is the one that perfectly suits you. As soon that stage is reached, you will feel so in tune with everything around you and what you do that to pursue for higher stages of MO will disappear from your awareness. You have achieved your Karmic MO, the life you were supposed to life, whether the outside world wouldn't have forced you to mutilate your self to survive. Beyond here, any further purification would be detrimental to your life and therefore is discouraged. In the pursue of MO, higher does not mean “better”, means different. "as above, so below"
How do you work in your magnum opus? With the 2 processes, Solve et Coagula:
dissolving is the process of looking within, meditate, reflect, journal etc... a good dissolving catalyst is a question about yourself and your life, once asked, your essence will try to bring up a clear answer, you will use your intellect (also symbolized with a sword) to divide and analyze your psyche and discard the noise from the signal in order to get this answer with your consciousness. Psychedelics are also good, in fact, the best dissolving catalyst, therefore the modern alchemy journey will be in fact hand in hand with your psychedelic journey jto aid you achieve your MO.
solidifying is the call for action, for putting the now purified pieces together in a solid, that is manifestable way, the process of acting in a certain way, more akin to your true form, with the learnings of what you acquired in the dissolving process is a solidifying process, anything that puts into action and practice the wisdom of a dissolving process, will in turn create a change in yourself, that change is the solidifying process. Practicing a skill is a good solidifying process, integrating the psychedelic experience is a so too. Repeating until it becomes who you are, then you are a purest form of yourself.
Now, repeat.
Great, but how do you navigate through the process?
Following the direction of the 3 principles of modern alchemy
they are in fact mysteries, not fully graspable by polluted minds, yet graspable enough to grant a sense of direction towards your MO.
The all is one: there is one reality, if there were 2 realities, that would be thus, reality, making it one by design. you exist in it, you can see it and experience it right now as this text, as the thing you refer to when you say “I”. That “I” experience reality from a single point of view, and experiences emotions, thoughts, sensations, as well as the so called external world. Everything you experience is the environment, not only your spacial surroundings and weather, but your emotions, needs, thoughts, confusions and understandings, everything is in fact your environment, and thus, whatever difference between your inner world and the outer world is in fact an illusion. You and this screen and the space in between them are one same, an undifferentiated thing. Every fear you can experience is in fact based on the illusion of you being something different from the object of your fears. Now you don't need to understand anything of this at first, you will in due time, but for now all you need to understand is that you are much, much stronger than your imagination could ever grasp, everything you are attached to, or identify with keeps you smaller than you could be, and strength comes in numbers and union. Anything that points towards the opposites most likely a pollutant, that is not part of your true self.
the second princi“Know Thyself”






Revolution, Revelation, Rebellion 
Flight, Fight, Freeze the 666

In the old times, before mankind knew what rain actually was, alchemy tried to explain reality and the nature of the universe. The precursor to chemistry had a magnum opus, which was to turn lead into gold, and achieve inmortality by mixing and manipulating the elements of nature into a perfect element, the philosopher stone.
Old alchemy was in many ways the grand father of modern science.
Back then, knowledge you take for granted was not known, and the limits between the natural and supernatural was not as well defined as we believe to have them today. that is why immortality was mixed in the whole formula, spirit was back then just another element, as real as air is to you.
It's said that back then, the one who would adventure into finding the philosopher stone would have a personal, deep spiritual change to themselves, as if the effort of purifying the elements outside of them, would interchangeably purify their spirit. You need an incredible mind to look into a flame with full attention, for nights on end, to see if something changes in your process. thinking about it, that's meditation 1o1.
Its said that the person would be so changed by the time they rich the magnum opus, that they would not need what the philosopher stone granted. This is also a common pattern, not only in alchemy, but in the occult. the proemses that following a given path are very appealing to your ego, wealth, immortality, 50 virgins, eternal bliss... now walking the path purifyes you to the point of not needing those things, you transcended the attachments and wants from your flesh, and can guide oters on their paths.
Now we have roquets and are on the verge of becoming obsolete by AI (whe are not even close but mankind is a neurotic animal LOL) and science have all the answers, exept the ones that any person would need to know in order to don't fall pray to things such as narcisism, addiction, suicide murder or explain what the meaning of your existence is and how is worth the pain that carry.
The modern world has put effort in technology in hopes to solve their problems, but let's be honest, is both creating more problems than is solving, and is fixing the most superficial ones. After all, the names changed, we are still seeking the same as old alchemist, wealth generation and longer lifespans.
In the midsts of all this, we are thrown into a world that does not give any fucking explanation or directive about how to deal with the most basic of your existencial needs. You don't need a new phone to survive, you need the healthy, real and in-person relationships you are trying to proxy with the fake sosial media that is little by little turning you mad.
Modern alchemy is my effort to create a field that is more encompassing, that has room for science and the first principles of the world, but at the same time recognizes our metaphisics and spirituality, to create a path of personal transformation.
you see, maybe, guilt and angst cannot be put on a scale and measured with technology, but if they can convince a perfectly working, healthy human being to kill himself, to me is very reall and we have to do something about it.
So, we will engage our abstract thinking, imagination, and self suggestion cappavilities with symbols and personal rituals, I will create a theme that will be appealing and inspiring, but the principles are for everyone, the principles are what matters, if something don't resonate with you, change it.
Now, my intention is not to give a whole new belief system, that waht religion does, my intention is to lay the start of a path towards personal empowerment, and inner transformation, and self revellion against whatever beliefs where installed in your psycology against being exactly and unicly who you are.
- [x] What is MA?
- [x] Who needs Modern Alchemy?
	- those who have the feeling that something is not right, and nothing yet has the answers, and at the same time have the inner fire of revellion inside, but are confused about how to channel it.
- [x] How does it difeers from similar solutions?
- [x] What are the risks?
	- you will become involved in something different, a transformation path will transform you, and there is a reason why you have not done that yet. you will adventure to do things that perhaps the other humans around you commonly believe to be dangerous and so they tagged as illegal. 
- [x] What are the wins?
- [x] What are the main principles?
	- The magnum opus, the filosofer stone is your essence, is the thing that observes and experience, is the only thing you cannot observe and never changes, pure awareness. Everything material, every shape you can think of, every thought you can imagine is a form, that can be transformed into "gold", wich is wealth, success, peace, hapyness, love etc, given that you purify yourself enought to get in touch with the Magnum opus.
- [x] How is it related to the left hand path?
	- The left hand path in a sense has been always related to rebellion, which this quest will require. appart from that, the rest is just a thematic.
- [x] What does it require to believe?
