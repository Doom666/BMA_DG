Intro:
"Welcome Alchemists to a new episode of Black Metal Alchemist. My name is Carlos and today..." 
VP: I will share with you a Modern Alchemy Process to transmutate any emotional state, into another of your choosing, at will.
Learning, practicing and mastering this process will put you in controll of your emotional states.

Last week I talked about how do we build the mental prisons that makes us miserable, I touch on using anger to get free from them, but, how do become angry when you feel hopeless? if you can do that, can you transform insecurity into lets say, pride? fear into calmness?
Absolutelly.

Emotions are a fundamental life of the Human experience, of you. If you want to Know yourself, youll need to understand some crucial information, which baffles me to see nobody sharing. Once we know of the origins, their purpose and mechanics we will get into the process itself. 

---
The source : evolution point of view

---
its function : cybernetic point of view

---
destroying the social belief of judjements

---
Note, impulse, cravings and internal sensations like Gut feeing, hunger, lust
principle:  Emotions are the source of animal action.

---
Things to know about emotions:
- they are experienced as physical sensations in your body.
- they create a bias tendency towards a certain types of behaviour and thought.
- they consist of a Type and an Intensity.
- emotions are also subject to habituation, compulsion and addiction.
- repressing suppressing and denying your emotions will inevitably cause one or another type of illness, not only mental disorders, but specially autoinmune disises, respiratory or digestive... what ever part or system of your fisiology happens to be the weakest. after all emotions are in your nervous system and so is repressing them.
- Most times emotions are subtle enough to  go under the radar of our awareness, nonetheless, there is always an emotion at play.

The whiring.
the brain can be conceptualized as the subconscious, which controls and computes emotions, fisiology, reality construction and whatever other thing your brain does without your attention, thinking or will. And the Conscious, the intellect, what you use to plan strategize etc..
this 2 are connected in a way that they create a loop, sending back and forth information, but they are not able to access eachother. meaning that in the same way that you, the intellect, are not aware of how you process and create emotions, but you feel them, the emotional mind cannot fully grasp the difference between an image of an object in front of you, and an object you bring consciously to your minds eye.
Now, the emotional mind is the one who does the heaby lifting, not you, that's also why you cannot make yourself get out of the couch, or cannot get to do what you want always.
and now you know everything necessary to understand how absurd, toxic and nonsensical the advice of most self help industry consisting in brute-force your will into action, against your emotional mind. Try instead, of giving a meaningful reason to actually invest its energy in whatever stupid thing you want to do. Negotiate instead of trying to force the one calling the shots.
NOTE: as a security measure, the Emotional mind will shut down the connection to the intellect in case of emergency or high emotional arousal. This is a feature, not an error. this is why in times of high stress, fear or anger you wont think logically at all.

Let's begin with the Alchemy
The strategy of this Process is to change the system from the inner loop.
in other words, we will craft a specific thougth that will catalyse one emotion into another.will call them catalysts. Lastly you will need another thought that will trigger you into action, a choice, lets call them release.

The catalist is a mental picture, story, statement, that contextualizes your current situation in a way that evokes a particular emotional reaction. in short, something that reminds you that "A" means B.
so to craft it, you need:
- the current situation CS (in which you feel this way) 
- the strongest natural triggers NT of your desired state
- a context, point of view, or framing around the Current Situation that reminds you or helps you realize of its natura trigger nature
Worth knowing: The key for this to work, is to create the catalist with undeniable self evident truths. the moment in witch you involve wishfull thinking, far fetched concepts, or straight out lies, the emotional mind will understand that something is up and ignore the whole thing, you two are after all, what creates reality itself. AKA affirmations are ridiculously innefective.

let's apply the process of Solve et Coagula with writing in order to get the pieces that we need to craft the catalyst:

Lets say that you want to turn self doubt and insecurity into anger:
You already have the current situation, so we need the trigger and context or frame:
What triggers anger within you?
Unjustice? being lied to?  lack of common sense? pineapple in the pizza?
list or clarify this by yourself, you must know this as the number of fingers in your left hand.
again, know thyself

---
Let's say that your triggers are unfairness, being lied to and being forced.
now, taking the situation of "you feeling insecure" come up with a frame to it that makes it undeniable unfair, product of lies, or is being forced on you.
How is this unfair? a product of lies you've been told? how are you being forced into this situation?
brainstorm untill you craft the most straight forward, concise and direct frame. Then put it together so you are sure that you can bring it all at once.
And there you go, that thought is your catalyst.

---
The trigger is just a short statement that you relate with action.
Fuck it, let's go, that ends now, thats it, or no word at all, just remember that you must release the catalized emotion into an action even if the action is symbolic like, pushups, writing a blog post, cleaning your place, sending a cv whatever.
once the action completes the process is done, and the connection is marked as successfull in your brain, making it easier next time.

---
Caviats of this process

You need to release with action, not doing so is dangerous.

if you content yourself with just Not Feeling the emotion wanted to change, and so you dont act in your envioronment all that is getting reinforce is an internal loop, done enough times, you'll do that automatically, and then can become compulsive, neurotic, and will close you in your mind, allways thinking, never doing anything, allways angry pissed and bitter (in this case) etc.

---
so, if you are not gonna do an action, dont do this.

---
one personal example

I feel sad or insecure or drained.
I am right now paralized with self doubt and second guessing myself to death while at the same time there is a fucking retard somewhere in the world about to do something horrible feeling way too good about his narcisistic self. I dont have to tolerate this.
