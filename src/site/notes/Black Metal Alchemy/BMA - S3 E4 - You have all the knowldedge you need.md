Most online content is based on making you believe that you need something you dont already have, specially knowledge.
You only belive this because is [[convenient to your ego\|convenient to your ego]].
Today you'll understand how this scheeme is paralizing your development
In the second part I'll talk about accessing the unconscious knowledge you already have.

I am gonna say things that might touch you, cut the crap. use humor
most questions  I see in me or others are not actuall questions:
- they are hidden questions beneath them.
	- What is the best way to do X?
		- How do I put the most minimal effort possible into doing X.?
	- How do I improve X skill?
		- How do I becomke X without practicing diligently?
	- How do you start a X?
		- How do I get X while avoiding confronting my fears?
	- How does X works?
		- I dont want to read or study how X works?
	- How do you stop X?
		- How do you stop X without feeling anything negatively?

Sound familiar? mee too.
good news -> there is a pattern.
All this are aversions to the 3 types or effort: emotional, intelectual and phisical effort.
your ego will preffer enduring pain over making an effort.
Example, getting fit:
- do exercise untill you are breathless or exhausted, every day and eat what you consider healthy.
- go on a crazy diet -> future me problem
- accept your lack of fittness. 
Example: how to learn programminng?
- read the official docs of the langage  back to back and solve problems daily.
- Follow a tutorial
- copy and paste ready code.

And so you get stuck in a cycle of feeling uncapable of achieving what you want.
Every time you pretend not to kmow something you give your power away.
