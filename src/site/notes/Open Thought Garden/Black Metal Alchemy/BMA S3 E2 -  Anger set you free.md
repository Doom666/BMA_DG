The rebellion starts from within

The first  time i concive modern alchemy was when I discovered that although emotions cannot be avoided, not ignored they can be channelled. 

There isna difference between hatred, anger and rage.
anger is powerful but dangerous... are you ready to play with fire?


anything I tell is my opinion
we have told to accept others beliefs as truths
so we hope to get someone else to tell us what to do/ think/ be like
if you act becasuse I act, you release the responsibility of your actions on me, if goes wront, wel  that was his fault.
all that is nonesense
your autonomy is sacred
your birthright is to be, act and think of your own accord.
but of course, this is just my opinion.
here is the importance of thinking by yourself and arriving to own conclussions.
what must happen within your skull for it to become your se are either of two things.
Abiding/accepting it by whatever authority you might perceive on me, the left right path way.
Questioning reflecting on it and arriving to your own conclusions of whether is valid or not, the left hand path way.
if you dont arrive to your conclussions, youll be repeating the statements withought knowing how I got there.
like knowing that 3^2=9, but when someone asks you why, you have no idea of what squared means, the information wont help you know what 5^2 is unless you learn what is to square a number.
A real life example: babies put to sleep alone, crying.
prison time to them
so this leads to the main point of the episode:
whatever is gonna make you move, must begin within you.
Here is something to think about.
there is one emotion that is shunned by society, but can be the only thing that puts you into action
from all emotions, the most explosive is anger.
anger is simbolized by fire for very good reasons, carefull
channel the anger in a mindfull way and you will get into change.
pitfalls Demonizing, self-hatred, tribalism
remember the first principle "the all is one"
well channel, fire is what makes engines move, badly channelled, is a catastrophe.
what are your existential no-no?
you have to do and accept what? why so?
is it acceptable to queep on living without knowing how to have a perfect self-steem? 
are you gonna accept the you are to old/young/ugly/short/whatever to do X?
are you gonna accept that life is how it is? that you had xYZ childhood? are you gonna accept to believe that ABC doors are closed to you? fucking why? you gonna accept that the world you live in is runned by lunatic psycopaths while your are drowning in self doubt? why?
youyhave to change yourself? why, where is that rule written in the universe?
as far as pragmatic consensus goes, if it does not break the laws of phisics, you can consider it possible.
this is how I would channel anger
to disrupt the assumptions that chokes your existence
I dont do that because I have anxiety/ADHD/Depression/borderline.... well dare to consider that that's someone's opinion, even if true, are you gonna accept to "have that"? to be what stops you?
and if you do say for example, I" dont want to put the effort to do X" then own it.
take that ugly thing of yourself and own it i dont do/learn/whatever because I dont want to due to X Y and Z reason.
free from hesitation
