## Raw Notes:
- The nature of insight is not self evident
- an insight is an immediate epiphany or aha moment
- the universe is capable to see into the truth of itself
- I believe that we are a vehicle to consciousness
- the objective and explicit part of of reality has a mysterious source
- What is understanding?
- DERIVING OUR OWN INSIGHTS IS WHAT REALY CHANGES THE WORLD, NOT PARROTING OTHER PEOPLE'S INSIGHTS
- Wondering is the source of insight, like fishing, wandering is like throwing the line, then you have to wait.
- What insights am I missing on my own persona?
- mystical experiences comes from the right hemisphere
- science is the left hemisphere
- There are gamma waves bursts 0.3 seconds before having an insight
- lower emotionality and high open minded ness relates to higher insight
- exposing oneself to diverse experience helps
- insight, only when I realize that my primal survival depends on being my own boss, I will make it.
- is of course possible to get insights no other human being has gotten or articulated
- a single insight can change your whole life
- Whatever problem you face in life, there are a set of insights you don't yet have, between you and the solution
- the quality of your life will be directly proportional to the depth and quality of your insights
- Re-derive answers by yourself
- You must explain and validate truths from your direct experience instead of adopting ides 


## Becoming more insightful:
- Become more relaxed: meditate and don't force insight
- requires positive mood and peace
- anxiety and fear causes mind noise
- do your homework: to connect the dots, you need the dots
- Question your assumptions: make a systematic list of the assumptions I have on X topic
	- Example
		- what are the core assumptions of Neuroscience?
			- the mind is contained inside the brain
- Harness deep curiosity, really wonder about the answers you don't have
- get a purpose, motive and ambition to have insight
- you have to love it, you have to care
- set a strong intention: "I need to solve this problem"
- block out large chunks of time for deep work and solitude
- Powerful questioning and contemplation
- make a list of the most important questions of your life
- become absorbed on one topic, one question
	- Can I do this?
- Allow your mind to wonder
	- the more distant dots you can connect the better
- be in a flow state: Remove distractions
- Disconnect from Socialization, drama and social media
- engage in unengaging tasks such a s walking, cleaning, driving etc. (Use work?) learn juggling, play an instrument
- don't over-schedule your days
- The more breaks: Insight requires incubation
- collaborate with others in a diverse team: Engage in deep conversations, create a mastermind Group
- Develop mindfulness.
- Take naps and take proper sleep
- Dream journal
- create an environment that leads to facilitate insights
- note your insights on the spot
- Do psychedelics responsibly
- develop your ability to articulate difficult ideas
	- metaphors
	- how to guide a person to have this insight?
