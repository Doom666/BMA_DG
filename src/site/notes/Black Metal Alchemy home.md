###### Welcome to my thoughts:

My Name is Carlos, I am a musician, coach and thinker with a catch. I am definitely not your average Musician/Coach/Thinker.

Some of my projects are the YouTube Channel [[Black Metal Alchemy/Black Metal Alchemist personal\|Black Metal Alchemist personal]] and here is the [[Black Metal Alchemy/Black Metal Alchemy blog\|Black Metal Alchemy blog]]
I follow closely the works of Leo Gura's Actualized.org. (Here are some of my notes on his videos)[[ActualizedOrg/Actualized video notes\|Actualized.org notes]]

But at the bottom of my heart all I want to do is metal music and revolutionize human education around the human condition and experience .
